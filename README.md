# Song-Idea-Generator-V3

Song-Idea-Generator
Generates song ideas based upon the data I've inputted.

Ive split songs into there core elements such as Melody, chord progression , drum pattern and ive inputted my favourite elements from many songs, I then use the randomise feature to generator different combinations , which grants me a near infinate amount of combinations. for more control for instance i created a variable called Specif , where i intentionally put specif elemts i want in order for me to have more control over the randomised feature.

New features allows user to select a specific element of a song they want generated. for instance by typing 4D, the app will generate a drum pattern for the individual.
